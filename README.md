# Context
This is a novelty 2017 data set from the University of British Columbia, Canada on lolly preferences during Halloween. The data contains all kinds of horrid inconsistencies and truly anarchic questions that make it hard to analyse. Cleaning this is the equivalent of competitive runners training in high-altitude conditions. For additional context, the survey originally presented to respondents can be found here: https://www.scq.ubc.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/candyhierarchysurvey2017.pdf 

# The Process
In this project, I use a variety of analysis techniques to polish the data. You'll find five main files in this repository. 
1. The raw data, as downloaded from the University of British Columbia.
2. A Jupyter notebook containing heavy-handed transforms.
3. The data post-transform, which is then loaded into a database using SSMS.
4. A T-SQL script for exploration.
5. The final output.

# Still to Do:
T-SQL exploration script.
