# Context
This is a novelty 2017 data set from the University of British Columbia, Canada on lolly preferences during Halloween. The data contains all kinds of horrid inconsistencies and truly anarchic questions that make it hard to analyse. Cleaning this is the equivalent of competitive runners training in high-altitude conditions. For additional context, the survey originally presented to respondents can be found here: https://www.scq.ubc.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/candyhierarchysurvey2017.pdf
